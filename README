This RESTful api will give you access to the omniture api. Even though the omniture API is a RESTful service, grails' expertise with JSON handling allows client requests and responses to be handled much more easily.

To get the most popular
/OmnitureGrails/reportSuite/mostpopular/<date>/<count> for example

I deliberately left the whole report as JSON output instead of individual fields to let the client decide how best to use the data.

On a groovy note, to create an array in the middle of a jsonbuilder use ([{}])
